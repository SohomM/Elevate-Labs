TASK-1 CALCULATOR

The calculator program is designed as a simple command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation is implemented as a separate function, which keeps the code modular and easy to understand. The main calculator function displays a menu where the user can choose the desired operation or exit the program. It uses a continuous loop so the calculator keeps running until the user decides to quit. For every valid choice, the program takes two numbers as input, performs the corresponding operation, and displays the result. Input validation is included to ensure that only numeric values are accepted, and special handling is provided to prevent errors such as division by zero. If the user enters an invalid choice or invalid numbers, the program shows an appropriate message and prompts again instead of crashing. Overall, the program demonstrates clean structure, error handling, and user interaction, making it a reliable and easy-to-use calculator application for the command line.

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS


1. Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

2. A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table and cannot have null values. A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

3. Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity. Examples include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK.

4. A surrogate key is an artificially generated key (often an auto-incremented number) used to uniquely identify a record when a natural primary key is not available or practical.

5. Data redundancy can be avoided by normalizing the database, enforcing constraints, using proper keys, and designing relationships between tables effectively.

6. An ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram is a visual representation of entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them in a database.

7. The main types of relationships in DBMS are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

8. AUTO\_INCREMENT automatically generates a unique sequential number for a column, usually used for primary keys, ensuring that each new row has a distinct identifier.

9. The default storage engine in MySQL is InnoDB.

10. A composite key is a primary key made up of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record in a table.


Do you want me to make these even more concise, like short exam-ready definitions in one line each?
