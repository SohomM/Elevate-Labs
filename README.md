TASK-1 CALCULATOR

The calculator program is designed as a simple command-line application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation is implemented as a separate function, which keeps the code modular and easy to understand. The main calculator function displays a menu where the user can choose the desired operation or exit the program. It uses a continuous loop so the calculator keeps running until the user decides to quit. For every valid choice, the program takes two numbers as input, performs the corresponding operation, and displays the result. Input validation is included to ensure that only numeric values are accepted, and special handling is provided to prevent errors such as division by zero. If the user enters an invalid choice or invalid numbers, the program shows an appropriate message and prompts again instead of crashing. Overall, the program demonstrates clean structure, error handling, and user interaction, making it a reliable and easy-to-use calculator application for the command line.
